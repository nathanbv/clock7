# Clock7
__A 3D printed, illuminated, colored, connected, smart powered, 7 segmented clock__

This project was inspired by the design of the beautiful but discontinued [ClockONE by Twelve24](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/twelve24/clockone-by-twelve24) kickstarter and more recently brought back to my memory by the [Huge Seven Segment Display made by engineerish](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2977443).

The goal of this project is to create a wall clock made out of 4 of these huge seven segment displays and connected somehow by two dots in the middle separating the hours from the minutes so the final things looks like the ClockONE.
The clock will be illuminated by a strip of WS2812B commonly named NeoPixels so that the 7seg displays can be controlled individually, and so the brightness and color of the light can be changed.

#### The rest of the informations on the ongoing work and advencement of the build can be found over on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/161551-clock7).
